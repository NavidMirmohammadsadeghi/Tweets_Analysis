I am intrested in doing some text mining on this data set, currently it is a temporary data sample to test some methods on, eventually the methods will be tested on massive amounts of tweets.

# Introduction
Many users nowadays use Twitter to complain about poor services that they recieved from different companies.
Based on recation time and the quality of answers from the service providers, customers would understand how much their satisfaction would matter to the service provider. Considering available text mining libraries in different programming languages, we can evaluate the efficiency of customer support services, and their success rates in satisfying customers!
